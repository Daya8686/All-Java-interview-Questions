# 61. Does Java work as a "pass by value" or "pass by reference" phenomenon?


## Java: Pass by Value

Java strictly works as "pass by value", meaning that it always passes a copy of the variable to methods, not the actual reference or object itself.

### How It Works:

#### For Primitive Types (e.g., `int`, `char`, etc.):
- Java passes a copy of the actual value. Any modifications within the method do not affect the original variable.

#### For Object References:
- Java passes a copy of the reference (pointer to the object), not the actual object itself. Changes to the objectâ€™s fields through this reference inside the method will reflect in the original object, but if the reference itself is reassigned, it will not affect the original reference.

### Example:

```java
void modifyPrimitive(int x) {
    x = 10;
}

void modifyObject(MyObject obj) {
    obj.setField("newValue");  // Affects original object
    obj = new MyObject();      // Doesn't affect original reference
}
```
