# 04. What is Write Once, Run Anywhere concept in Java?

## Platform Independence of Java

### Platform Independence
Java code is compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform with a JVM, ensuring that Java programs are not dependent on the underlying operating system.

### Portability
Java's WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) philosophy ensures that once code is written, it can run anywhere without modification on any device or operating system that supports a JVM.

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
The JVM abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, providing a unified environment to execute Java bytecode.

### No Compilation for Each Platform
Java programs donâ€™t need to be compiled separately for each platform, unlike languages like C or C++.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Java supports applications running across diverse systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile platforms without needing platform-specific adjustments.
