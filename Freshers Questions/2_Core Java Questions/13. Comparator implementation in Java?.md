# 13. Comparator implementation in Java?


## Comparator Interface in Java

### Definition
The `Comparator` interface is used to define custom orderings for objects. It provides more flexibility than `Comparable` by allowing multiple ways of comparing objects. It takes 2 arguments as input to compare.

> **Note:** This sorting is a custom sorting which is implemented in another class and used when we are sorting objects. It will take 2 arguments. We can sort objects with `Collections.sort(ListOfObjects, new StudentComparatorObj)` or `Arrays.sort(ArrayOfObjects, new StudentComparatorObj)`.

### Method
- **compare()**: Defines the logic for comparing two objects.

### Syntax
```java
public class ClassNameComparator implements Comparator<ClassName> {
    @Override
    public int compare(ClassName obj1, ClassName obj2) {
        // Comparison logic
    }
}
```

## Comparator Interface in Java

### Use Case
The `Comparator` interface is used when you want to define multiple sorting criteria. For instance, you might want to sort `Student` objects by both their name and age.

### Condition
- The class does not need to implement the `Comparator`. The `Comparator` can be created externally.
- The `compare()` method should return:
  - A negative integer if `obj1` is smaller.
  - Zero if `obj1` is equal.
  - A positive integer if `obj1` is larger.

### Rules
- **Consistency:** The `compare()` method should be consistent with the `equals` method when used with sorting algorithms.
- **Multiple Comparators:** You can create as many comparator implementations as needed to define different sorting behaviors.

### Example

```java
public class NameComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return s1.getName().compareTo(s2.getName());  // Sort by name
    }
}
```


```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SortStudents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student[] students = {
            new Student("Alice", 3),
            new Student("Bob", 1),
            new Student("Charlie", 2)
        };

        // Sorting the array using the NameComparator
        Arrays.sort(students, new NameComparator());

        // Displaying the sorted array
        for (Student student : students) {
            System.out.println(student);
        }
List<Student> std= new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(new Student("Alice", 3), new Student("Bob", 1), new Student("Charlie", 2)));

Collections.sort(std, new NameComparator);

for (Student student : std) {
            System.out.println(student);
        }

    }
}


```
