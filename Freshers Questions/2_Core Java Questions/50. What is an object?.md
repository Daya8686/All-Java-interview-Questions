# 50. What is an object?


### Definition:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods) as defined by the class.

### State:
- The values of the attributes (fields) in the object.

### Behavior:
- The actions the object can perform, defined by methods.

### Explanation:
```java
class Car {
    String model;  // Field
    int year;      // Field

    // Constructor
    Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving " + model);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2022); // Creating an object
        myCar.drive();  // Invoking a method
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- myCar is an object of the class `Car`, which has its own `model` and `year` attributes.
- The object interacts with its environment by invoking methods like `drive()`.
#### Summary:
- An object is a concrete instance of a class with its own `state` and `behavior`.
- Objects are created from a class using the `new` keyword.
