# 62. Difference Between System.out, System.err, and System.in


## System Streams in Java

### System.out:
- **Description:** It is the standard output stream that prints data to the console (usually for regular messages or results).
- **Common Methods:** It is usually used with `print()` and `println()` methods.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  ```

### System.err:
- **Description:** It is the standard error output stream used to output error messages or diagnostics.
- **Behavior:** It operates similarly to `System.out`, but can be directed to a different output (like a log file) to separate error messages from regular output.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  System.err.println("An error occurred!");
  ```

### System.in:
- **Description:** It is the standard input stream used to read input from the user (typically through the keyboard).
- **Common Usage:** It is usually wrapped in an `InputStreamReader` or `Scanner` for easy handling.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
  String input = scanner.nextLine();
  ```
