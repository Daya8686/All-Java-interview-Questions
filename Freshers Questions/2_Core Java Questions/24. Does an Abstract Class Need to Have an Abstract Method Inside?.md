# 24. Does an Abstract Class Need to Have an Abstract Method Inside?

## Abstract Classes Without Abstract Methods in Java

### Definition
No, an abstract class does not need to have an abstract method inside it. In Java, a class can be declared abstract without containing any abstract methods.

### Purpose of an Abstract Class Without Abstract Methods
- **Base Class Functionality:** It serves as a base class that provides some shared functionality but is not meant to be instantiated on its own.
- **Common Implementation:** It can provide common implementation to its subclasses while enforcing that it should not be instantiated directly.

### Example

```java
public abstract class BaseClass {
    // No abstract methods, but still an abstract class
    public void commonMethod() {
        System.out.println("Common implementation");
    }
}
```
Even though the class doesn't have abstract methods, it still cannot be instantiated directly:

```java

BaseClass obj = new BaseClass();  // Compilation error
```
