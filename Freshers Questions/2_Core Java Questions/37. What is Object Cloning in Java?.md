# 37. What is Object Cloning in Java?

## Object Cloning in Java

Object cloning in Java refers to creating an exact copy of an object. The `clone()` method in the `java.lang.Object` class is used to perform cloning, and the object being cloned must implement the `Cloneable` interface.

### Key Concepts of Object Cloning

#### `clone()` Method:
- **Defined in:** The `Object` class.
- **Functionality:** Creates a new object that is a copy of the original object.

### Syntax:
```java
Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
```
**To use `clone()`, the class must:**
- Implement the `Cloneable` interface.
- Override the `clone()` method, typically making it public.

#### `Cloneable` Interface:
- **Type:** Marker interface (contains no methods).
- **Purpose:** Indicates that a class allows its objects to be cloned.
- **Exception:** If the class doesn’t implement `Cloneable`, calling `clone()` will throw a `CloneNotSupportedException`.

### Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy

#### Shallow Copy:
- **Behavior:** The default behavior of `clone()`.
- **Copies:** Copies the object’s fields as-is.
- **References:** References to other objects are copied as references (not duplicated).
- **Changes:** Changes to referenced objects in the clone reflect in the original.

#### Deep Copy:
- **Behavior:** Creates an independent copy of the object, including all objects it references.
- **Implementation:** Requires custom implementation (manually cloning referenced objects).

### Shallow Copy Example

```java
class Address {
    String city;

    Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    Address address;

    Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Shallow copy
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Address address = new Address("New York");
        Person person1 = new Person("John", address);
        Person person2 = (Person) person1.clone();

        // Modifying the address of person2
        person2.address.city = "Los Angeles";

        System.out.println(person1.address.city); // Output: Los Angeles (shared reference)
    }
}
```
### Deep Copy Example
```java
class Address implements Cloneable {
    String city;

    Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Cloning Address
    }
}

class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    Address address;

    Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Person cloned = (Person) super.clone();
        cloned.address = (Address) address.clone(); // Deep copy of address
        return cloned;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Address address = new Address("New York");
        Person person1 = new Person("John", address);
        Person person2 = (Person) person1.clone();

        // Modifying the address of person2
        person2.address.city = "Los Angeles";

        System.out.println(person1.address.city); // Output: New York (independent copy)
    }
}
```
## Key Factors in Object Cloning

### Default Behavior (Object Class):
- **Performs a shallow copy.**
- **Fields of primitive types are copied as values.**
- **References to objects are copied as references.**

### Custom Deep Cloning:
- **To achieve a deep copy, override the `clone()` method and manually clone referenced objects.**

### Performance:
- **`clone()` is faster than creating objects manually in some cases but can lead to subtle bugs if not implemented correctly.**

### When to Use:
- **Suitable for creating duplicates where all or most fields of the object need to be the same.**
- **Deep cloning is ideal when the cloned object must not share references with the original.**

## Alternatives to Cloning

### Copy Constructors:

**Example:**
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    Address address;

    Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = new Address(address.city); // Deep copy
    }
}
```
### Serialization and Deserialization:
- Serialize the object to a byte stream and then deserialize it to create a new instance (deep copy).

## Pros and Cons of Cloning

| **Pros**                                  | **Cons**                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Faster than manually copying fields.      | Default behavior only provides shallow copy.  |
| Easy to implement for simple objects.     | Requires implementing `Cloneable`.            |
| Can be extended for deep cloning.         | Overriding `clone()` can be error-prone.      |

## Conclusion

- **Shallow Copy:** Default behavior of `clone()`. References are shared.
- **Deep Copy:** Requires manual implementation to duplicate referenced objects.
- **Cloneable Interface:** Marker interface signaling the ability to clone.
- **Alternatives:** Copy constructors and serialization can be used for similar purposes but with more control and flexibility.
