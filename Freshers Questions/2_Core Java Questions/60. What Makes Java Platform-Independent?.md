# 60. What Makes Java Platform-Independent?


## Java Platform Independence

Java is platform-independent due to the concept of bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### How It Works:

1. **Compilation to Bytecode:**
   - When Java code is compiled, it is transformed into bytecode by the Java compiler (`javac`). Bytecode is an intermediate, machine-independent code that can be executed on any platform.

2. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**
   - Each platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) has its own JVM implementation. The JVM reads the bytecode and translates it into machine-specific instructions, enabling Java programs to run on different platforms without modification.

### "Write Once, Run Anywhere":
- Javaâ€™s platform independence comes from the fact that the same bytecode can run on any system that has a JVM.

### Example:
- Java bytecode (`.class` file) generated on a Windows machine can be run on a Linux or macOS machine, provided those systems have a JVM installed.

### Why Platform-Independent:
- The separation of the compile-time (bytecode) and runtime (JVM) environments allows Java to remain platform-independent.
