# 17. What is the finalize() Method in Java?

## The `finalize()` Method in Java

### Definition
The `finalize()` method is a part of Java's garbage collection mechanism. It is called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed and used to perform cleanup operations such as releasing resources (e.g., closing file streams or database connections).

### Usage
The method is defined in the `Object` class and can be overridden in user-defined classes to perform actions before the object is destroyed.

#### Syntax
```java
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    // cleanup code
}
```
### Is it Still Used?
The `finalize()` method is deprecated in modern Java (starting with Java 9) because it has several drawbacks:
- **Uncertainty:** It is not guaranteed when, or if, the garbage collector will call `finalize()`.
- **Performance Overhead:** Finalization introduces significant performance costs.
- **Potential for Memory Leaks:** If an object is referenced in the `finalize()` method, it can cause memory retention, leading to memory leaks.

### Why It Is Not Used Now
Instead of relying on `finalize()`, Java developers now use more reliable alternatives such as:
- **try-with-resources** for managing resources like files or streams.
- **PhantomReference** for more fine-grained control over resource cleanup.
