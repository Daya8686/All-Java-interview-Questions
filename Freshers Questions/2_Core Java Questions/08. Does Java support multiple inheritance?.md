# 08. Does Java support multiple inheritance?


## Multiple Inheritance in Java

In traditional object-oriented languages, multiple inheritance refers to a class inheriting properties and methods from more than one class. Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but it does allow multiple inheritance with interfaces.

### Reasons Why Java Does Not Support Multiple Inheritance with Classes

1. **Diamond Problem:**
   - One of the primary reasons Java avoids multiple inheritance is the Diamond Problem, which arises when two classes (both inheriting from the same parent) have conflicting method definitions. Java avoids this complexity by only allowing single inheritance with classes.

2. **Simplicity:**
   - Multiple inheritance introduces complexity in method resolution, leading to ambiguous scenarios. By restricting inheritance to a single parent class, Java simplifies the object model.

### Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces

- **Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces.** This provides some of the benefits of multiple inheritance without the complications of inheriting from multiple classes. If conflicting method signatures exist between interfaces, the implementing class must resolve the conflict.
```java
interface InterfaceA {
    void commonMethod();
}

interface InterfaceB {
    void commonMethod();
}

class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    @Override
    public void commonMethod() {
        System.out.println("Resolved common method implementation");
    }
}

```


### Default Methods in Interfaces

- **Since Java 8, default methods in interfaces allow interfaces to include method implementations.** This provides another form of multiple inheritance, as a class can inherit default methods from multiple interfaces, but it must resolve conflicts if methods with the same signature are inherited.
```java
interface InterfaceA {
   default void display() {
       System.out.println("Display from InterfaceA");
   }
}

interface InterfaceB {
   default void display() {
       System.out.println("Display from InterfaceB");
   }
}

class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
   @Override
   public void display() {
       InterfaceA.super.display(); // or InterfaceB.super.display();
   }
}

public class TestMultipleInheritance {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       MyClass obj = new MyClass();
       obj.display(); // Calls the display method from InterfaceA or InterfaceB
   }
}

```


### Abstract Classes and Interfaces

- **Java provides abstract classes and interfaces to allow flexible and modular code design.** You can use interfaces to simulate multiple inheritance where necessary, and abstract classes to provide partial implementation.
