# 35. How do you decide if an inner class is required?

## Deciding If an Inner Class Is Required

An inner class is typically used when a class is tightly coupled with the outer class or needs direct access to the outer class's members. Here are some situations where you might decide to use an inner class:

### Logical Grouping
If a class logically belongs to another class but doesn’t make sense outside it, an inner class is a good choice.
**Example:** `Engine` inside a `Car` class.

### Enhancing Encapsulation
If you want to hide the inner class from outside classes, making it private or package-private helps encapsulate its behavior.

### Tight Coupling with Outer Class
If the inner class needs to frequently access the outer class's methods or fields, a non-static inner class can be used.

### Short-lived Use
If you need a class that’s only used within a single method, a **local inner class** or **anonymous class** can be defined inside that method.

### Simplifying Code Structure
When multiple classes are closely related and placing them in separate files would make your code harder to read or maintain, inner classes can simplify the structure.

### Example of a Logical Use of an Inner Class

```java
class Car {
    private String model;
    
    class Engine {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Starting engine of " + model);
        }
    }
}
```
