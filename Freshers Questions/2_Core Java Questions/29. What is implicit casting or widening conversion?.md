# 29. What is implicit casting or widening conversion?

## Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion) in Java

### Definition
Implicit casting, also known as widening conversion, occurs when a value of a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger data type without the need for explicit casting by the programmer. This is done by Java automatically, as there is no risk of data loss.

### Examples of Implicit Casting
- Converting `int` to `long`.
- Converting `float` to `double`.
- Converting `char` to `int`.

### Rules
- The target type must be larger or compatible with the source type.
- No explicit cast is needed, as the conversion is safe.

### Example

```java
int num = 100;
long bigNum = num;  // Implicit casting from int to long
```
