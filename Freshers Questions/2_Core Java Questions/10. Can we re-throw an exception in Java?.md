# 10. Can we re-throw an exception in Java?

## Re-Throwing Exceptions in Java

Yes, in Java, it is possible to re-throw an exception after it has been caught. This is often done to pass the responsibility of handling the exception to the calling method or layer of the application.

### Key Points

1. **Catching and Re-throwing**:
   - You can catch an exception in a `catch` block and then re-throw it using the `throw` keyword. This is useful if you want to add additional logic before passing the exception back to the caller.
```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Log or perform some actions
    throw e;  // Re-throw the exception
}
```

2. **Changing the Exception Type**:
   - You can also throw a different type of exception after catching one. For example, catching a `SQLException` and re-throwing it as a `RuntimeException`.
```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Database error occurred", e);
}
```
3. **Preserving Stack Trace**:
   - When you re-throw an exception, the original stack trace is preserved, which helps in identifying where the exception initially occurred. However, if you want to throw a new exception, you can pass the original exception as a cause.

4. **Custom Exception Handling**:
   - Re-throwing exceptions is useful in layered architectures where the low-level exception is caught, logged, and then re-thrown as a custom exception (e.g., `ServiceException`) to decouple the layers of the application.


5. **Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**:
   - When re-throwing exceptions, be mindful of whether they are checked (must be declared in the method signature using `throws`) or unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions that do not need declaration).

### Example

```java
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class ExceptionHandlingExample {

    public void performDatabaseOperation() throws CustomException {  //thows is not required if we are not using checked exception
        try {
            // Code that might throw SQLException
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Add custom logic, logging, etc.
            throw new CustomException("Database operation failed", e); // Re-throwing as custom exception
        }
    }
}

class CustomException extends Exception {       //checked exception
    public CustomException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
