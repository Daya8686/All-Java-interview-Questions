# 33. What will be the result if Java sets the main method to private/protected?

## Declaring the `main` Method as Private in Java

If you declare the `main` method as private, the program will compile successfully, but it will throw a runtime exception (`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`) because the JVM cannot access a private `main` method to start the execution.

This same for `protected` as well.
>This is same for `private` and `protected` declared with `main`

### Example

```java
public class MainTest {
    private static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method is private!");
    }
}
```
## Private `main` Method:
- The program will compile successfully because Java does not enforce a specific access modifier for the main method at compile-time.
- However, when you try to run the program, the JVM will not be able to access the main method due to its private visibility.
- This will result in a runtime error, specifically a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main` or `Main method not found in class <ClassName>` error message, indicating that the JVM could not find an accessible main method.

## Protected `main` Method:
- Similar to the private modifier, the program will compile without issues.
- At runtime, the JVM will also fail to access the main method due to its protected visibility, leading to the same `NoSuchMethodError` or `Main method not found in class <ClassName>` error.
### Result:
**Compilation:** The code will compile without errors.
**Execution:** When you run the program, the JVM will try to find a public main method. Since it is private, the JVM will not find it and will throw:
```css

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main
```
### Key Points:
- The main method must be public for the JVM to invoke it.
- If the method is private, JVM cannot access it, leading to an error.
