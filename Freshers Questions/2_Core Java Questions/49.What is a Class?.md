## 49. What is a Class?

### Definition:
A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

### Components:
A class can have:
- **Fields (attributes):** Represent the state or data of the object.
- **Methods (behaviors):** Define the actions the object can perform.
- **Constructors:** Special methods to initialize the object.
- **Static members:** Attributes or methods shared across all instances of the class.

### Example:
```java
class Car {
    String model;  // Field
    int year;      // Field

    // Constructor
    Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving " + model);
    }
}
```
#### Summary:
- A class defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- Objects are instances of a class
