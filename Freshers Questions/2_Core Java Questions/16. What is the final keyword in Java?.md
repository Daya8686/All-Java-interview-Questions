# 16. What is the final keyword in Java?


## The `final` Keyword in Java

### 1. Definition
In Java, the `final` keyword is used to restrict the user from changing the value of a variable, modifying a method, or extending a class. It ensures that the behavior or structure remains constant once defined.



### 1.1. Final Variables
When a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed once initialized.

- **Declaration:** A `final` variable must be initialized once.
- **Use Case:** Often used in defining constants.
### Example:
```java

final int MAX_LIMIT = 100;
```
In this case, `MAX_LIMIT` cannot be modified after its initial assignment.

### 1.2. Final Methods
When a method is declared as `final`, it cannot be overridden by any subclass. This is useful when we want to prevent specific behavior from being changed by subclass inheritance.

- **Use Case:** Used when we want to lock the functionality of a method in inheritance.
### Example:
```java

public class Parent {
    public final void display() {
        System.out.println("Final method.");
    }
}
```
A subclass of `Parent` cannot override the `display()` method.

### 1.3. Final Classes
A class marked as `final` cannot be subclassed or extended. It prevents the inheritance of the class.

- **Use Case:** When you want to create immutable objects or classes whose behavior should not be altered.

### Example:
```java

final class FinalClass {
    // class body
}
```
Any attempt to subclass `FinalClass` will result in a compilation error.

### 1.4. Final and Performance
- **Java Optimization:** The use of `final` can help in JVM optimizations since the compiler knows certain behavior (e.g., methods) won't change.
- **Immutable Classes:** Final variables and methods are often used in immutable classes, where the state of the object doesn't change after construction.
