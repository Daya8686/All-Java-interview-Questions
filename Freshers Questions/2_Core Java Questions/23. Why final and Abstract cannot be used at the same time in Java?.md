# 23. Why final and Abstract cannot be used at the same time in Java?


## Why `final` and `abstract` Cannot Be Used at the Same Time in Java

### Definition
The `final` and `abstract` keywords cannot be used together in Java because they have contradictory purposes:

- **`final` Class/Method:** A `final` class cannot be subclassed, and a `final` method cannot be overridden. It is used to prevent any modification or extension.
- **`abstract` Class/Method:** An `abstract` class must be subclassed to provide implementation for its abstract methods, and an `abstract` method must be overridden in subclasses.

### Conflict
An `abstract` method must be overridden by a subclass, while a `final` method cannot be overridden. Thus, using both together doesnâ€™t make sense because you would be asking to provide an implementation in a subclass while simultaneously preventing subclassing or overriding.

### Example (Invalid Code)

```java
public abstract final class MyClass {  // Compilation error
}
```
