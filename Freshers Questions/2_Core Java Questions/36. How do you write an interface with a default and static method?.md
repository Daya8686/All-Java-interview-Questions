# 36. How do you write an interface with a default and static method?


## Default and Static Methods in Java 8 Interfaces

In Java 8, interfaces were enhanced to allow default and static methods. This was done to add new functionalities to interfaces without breaking the implementing classes. Here's how you define and use them:

### Default Method
A default method in an interface provides a method body and can be overridden by implementing classes.

**Why Introduced:** To provide backward compatibility when new methods are added to interfaces without forcing all implementing classes to implement them.

### Static Method
A static method in an interface is a method that belongs to the interface itself and cannot be overridden by implementing classes.

**Why Introduced:** To allow utility methods specific to the interface without needing external helper classes.

### Syntax

```java
interface MyInterface {

    // Default Method
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method in the interface.");
    }

    // Static Method
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in the interface.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.defaultMethod();  // Call the default method

        // Call the static method using the interface name
        MyInterface.staticMethod();
    }
}
```
### Where to Use:
- Default Method: Use it when you want to provide a default behavior in your interface but still allow implementing classes to override it.
- Static Method: Use it for utility functions related to the interface, which don't depend on instance state.
