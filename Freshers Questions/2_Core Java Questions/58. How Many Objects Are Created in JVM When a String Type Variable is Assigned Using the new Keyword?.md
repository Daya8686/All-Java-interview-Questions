# 58. How Many Objects Are Created in JVM When a String Type Variable is Assigned Using the new Keyword?


## Creation of String Objects in Java Using `new` Keyword

### When a string is created using the `new` keyword, two objects may be created:

### 1. Heap Memory Object:
- The `new` keyword explicitly creates a new `String` object in the heap, even if the same content exists in the string pool.

### 2. String Pool Object (Optional):
- If the string literal does not already exist in the string pool, a new string object is also created in the string pool.

### Example:
```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
```
### Heap Object:
- A new `String` object is created in the heap memory.

### String Pool:
- If `"Hello"` is not already in the string pool, a new object is created there too.

### Total Objects:
- **1 or 2:** One in the heap (always), and optionally one in the string pool (if it doesn't already exist).
