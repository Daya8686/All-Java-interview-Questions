# 30. What is explicit casting or narrowing conversion?


## Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion) in Java

### Definition
Explicit casting, also known as narrowing conversion, occurs when a value of a larger data type is forcibly converted to a smaller data type. Since narrowing conversion may result in data loss, Java requires an explicit cast to be specified by the programmer.

### Examples of Explicit Casting
- Converting `double` to `float`.
- Converting `long` to `int`.
- Converting `int` to `short` or `byte`.

### Rules
- You must use explicit casting for narrowing conversions.
- There is a risk of precision loss or truncation.

### Example

```java
double num = 9.78;
int intNum = (int) num;  // Explicit casting from double to int
```

In this example, the decimal part will be truncated, and `intNum` will have the value `9`.
