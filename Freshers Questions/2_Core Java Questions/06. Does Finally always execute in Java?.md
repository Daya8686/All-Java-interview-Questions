# 06. Does Finally always execute in Java?

## The `finally` Block in Java

The `finally` block is used to execute important code such as resource cleanup, regardless of whether an exception is thrown. While it almost always executes, there are a few rare cases where it doesn't.

### Normal Execution
If there is no exception in the `try` block, the `finally` block will execute after the `try` block.

### Exception Handling
If an exception occurs in the `try` block and is caught by a `catch` block, the `finally` block will still execute after the `catch` block finishes.

### Return Statement
Even if there is a `return` statement in the `try` or `catch` block, the `finally` block will still execute before the method returns. This is because Java ensures the `finally` block is executed.

### Exception in `finally`
If an exception is thrown within the `finally` block itself, it will override any exception from the `try` or `catch` block. This is one of the rare cases where the `finally` block does not fully complete as expected.

### Non-Execution Cases

- **System.exit():** If `System.exit()` is called in the `try` or `catch` block, it will terminate the program immediately, preventing the `finally` block from running.
- **JVM Crash:** If the JVM crashes due to severe errors or hardware failures, the `finally` block will not execute.
- **Thread Interruption:** If the thread running the `finally` block is forcibly killed or interrupted, the block may not execute.
- **Exception:** If Exception occures in `finally` block then it will not execute completely.
