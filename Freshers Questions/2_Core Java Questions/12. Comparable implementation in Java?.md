# 12. Comparable implementation in Java?


## Comparable Interface in Java

### Definition
The `Comparable` interface is used to define the natural order of objects of a class. It has a single method, `compareTo()`, which is used by sorting methods (like `Collections.sort()`, `Arrays.sort()`) to compare objects.
> **Note:** This is implemented in the same class which is going to sort.

### Example
To sort a student by name, the `Student` class implements `Comparable<Student>`.

### Syntax
```java
public class ClassName implements Comparable<ClassName> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(ClassName obj) {
        // Comparison logic
    }
}
```

### Use Case
The `Comparable` interface is typically used when a class has a default sorting order. For example, sorting students by their ID by default. It is used in the same class to provide natural sorting.

### Condition
- The class must implement `Comparable<T>` where `T` is the type of the object.
- The `compareTo()` method must return:
  - A negative integer if this object is smaller.
  - Zero if this object is equal.
  - A positive integer if this object is larger.

### Rules
- The `compareTo()` method must be consistent with `equals()`. If two objects are considered equal by `compareTo()`, they should also be equal by `equals()`.
- The natural ordering defined by `Comparable` must be transitive and consistent.

### Example

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    private String name;
    private int id;

    public Student(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);  // Sort by student ID
    }
}
```
