# 15. Can We Override a Static Method in Java?


## Static Methods and Method Hiding in Java

### Definition
In Java, static methods belong to the class rather than the instance of the class. Overriding means providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass, but static methods cannot be overridden in the traditional sense because they are class-level methods.

### Use Case
When a method is static, it is bound to the class at compile-time (static binding), whereas overridden methods are bound at runtime (dynamic binding). Therefore, overriding a static method is not possible.

### Condition
You can hide a static method by redefining it in a subclass, but this is not true method overriding.

### Explanation
- **Overriding:** In method overriding, a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass. The method must have the same signature and be non-static.
- **Hiding:** When a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, this is called method hiding. The static method in the subclass hides the method in the superclass rather than overriding it.

### Rules
- **Static methods belong to the class:** Unlike instance methods, static methods are tied to the class. Hence, overriding does not apply to them.
- **Method hiding occurs:** If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as the static method in the superclass, the method in the superclass is hidden, and the subclass method is invoked if referenced through the subclass.
- **Cannot use `super` for static methods:** You cannot use `super` to invoke the superclass version of a hidden static method. Instead, you must use the class name.

### Example

```java
class Parent {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent static method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Child static method");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent.display(); // Outputs: Parent static method
        Child.display();  // Outputs: Child static method

        Parent p = new Child();
        p.display();      // Outputs: Parent static method (method hiding)
    }
}
```
In this case, **method hiding happens**, not overriding.
