# 39. What are the Conditions a Class Can Be Called Abstract?


## Abstract Classes in Java

A class in Java can be called **abstract** if it is declared with the `abstract` keyword. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract methods and non-abstract methods.

### Conditions for a Class to Be Abstract

1. **`abstract` Keyword:** The class must be declared with the `abstract` keyword.
```java
abstract class Animal { }
```
2. **Abstract Methods:** It may contain one or more abstract methods (methods without a body), but it's not necessary.
```java
abstract void sound();  // Abstract method
```
3. **Concrete Methods:** It can also contain concrete methods (methods with a body), unlike interfaces where all methods were abstract (until Java 8).
```java
void eat() {
    System.out.println("Eating...");
}
```
4. **Cannot be Instantiated:** An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.
```java
Animal animal = new Animal();  // Compilation error
```
5. **Subclass Requirement:** Any concrete subclass must provide implementations for all abstract methods, or the subclass must also be declared abstract.

### Example

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Concrete method
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Animal animal = new Animal(); // This would give an error

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark
        dog.sleep();     // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}
```
