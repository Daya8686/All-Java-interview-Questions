# 28. How to write multiple catch statements under a single try block?

  ## Handling Multiple Catch Statements in a Single Try Block in Java

In Java, you can handle multiple types of exceptions within a single try block by providing multiple catch statements. Each catch block is executed in the order in which it appears, and only one block will be executed based on the type of exception thrown.

This Exceptions must be in flow like fist most specific should come and then most generic should come.
### Syntax

> NOTE: Most specific exceptions first then slowly most general or generic exception are written in flow.


```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1 e) {    |  // Specific Exception 
    // Handle ExceptionType1    |
} catch (ExceptionType2 e) {    | // TO
    // Handle ExceptionType2    |
} catch (ExceptionType3 e) {    |// Generic Exception
    // Handle ExceptionType3    V
}
```

You can also use multi-catch blocks (since Java 7) to handle multiple exceptions in a single `catch` block, separated by a pipe (`|`):

```java

try {
    // Code that may throw exceptions
} catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
    // Handle both IOException and SQLException
}
```

### Example:
```java

try {
    int num = Integer.parseInt("abc");  // Will throw NumberFormatException
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    System.out.println("Number Format Exception");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("General Exception");
}
```
