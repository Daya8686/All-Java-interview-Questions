# 05. What is Marker Interface in Java?


## Marker Interface in Java

### Empty Interface
A marker interface is an interface with no methods; it simply marks a class as having a specific property or capability.

### Used for Metadata
Marker interfaces are used to provide metadata to the compiler or JVM, indicating certain behaviors or capabilities for a class.

### Example
A classic example is the `Serializable` interface, which marks a class as serializable, allowing it to be converted into a byte stream.

### Enables Special Handling
Classes implementing a marker interface are treated differently by frameworks, tools, or libraries. For example, the `Cloneable` interface allows cloning of objects.

### No Method Implementation
Unlike regular interfaces, marker interfaces do not contain any methods; their presence alone triggers specific functionality in the code or runtime environment.
