# 65. List the Features of the Java Programming Language


## Key Features of Java

1. **Platform-Independent:**
   - Java bytecode can be run on any platform with a JVM, supporting the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle.

2. **Object-Oriented:**
   - Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm with features like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

3. **Simple:**
   - Java eliminates complex features like pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance from C++, making it simpler to learn and use.

4. **Secure:**
   - Java has built-in security features, such as the absence of explicit pointers and built-in virus protection using the bytecode verifier and JVM.

5. **Robust:**
   - Java handles errors effectively using exceptions and eliminates memory management issues by using garbage collection.

6. **Multi-threaded:**
   - Java has built-in support for multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.

7. **High Performance:**
   - Java uses the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to improve performance, and the HotSpot JVM dynamically optimizes code execution.

8. **Distributed:**
   - Java supports distributed computing using technologies like RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and EJB (Enterprise Java Beans).
