# 18. Difference Between throw and throws in Java?

## `throw` and `throws` in Java

### Definition
Both `throw` and `throws` are related to exception handling, but they serve different purposes.

### 3.1. `throw` Keyword
- **Definition:** The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from any method or block of code. It is followed by an instance of an exception.
- **Use Case:** When you want to manually trigger an exception under specific conditions.

### Example:
```java

public void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older.");
    }
}
```

### 3.2. `throws` Keyword
- **Definition:** The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare exceptions that the method might throw during its execution. It indicates the types of exceptions a method can potentially propagate to the caller.
- **Use Case:** To declare that a method may throw one or more checked exceptions, and the caller of the method must handle or declare them.

### Example:
```java

public void readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
    // method logic
}

```
### Difference

| Feature       | `throw`                                 | `throws`                                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**   | Used to explicitly throw an exception.  | Declares that a method might throw an exception. |
| **Position**  | Appears inside the method body.         | Appears in the method signature.                 |
| **Exception Type** | Used to throw both checked and unchecked exceptions. | Typically used for checked exceptions.          |
| **Handling**  | Requires explicit handling of the exception. | Tells the caller to handle or declare the exception. |
