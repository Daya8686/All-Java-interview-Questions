# 45. How Do You Prevent a Class from Being Subclassed in Java?

## Preventing Subclassing in Java

To prevent a class from being subclassed in Java, there are several strategies available, each with a specific purpose. Here are all the ways:

### 1. Using the `final` Keyword on the Class
The most straightforward way to prevent subclassing is to declare the class as `final`. When a class is marked as `final`, it cannot be extended by any other class.

#### Example:
```java
final class Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the vehicle.");
    }
}

// This will cause a compilation error
// class Car extends Vehicle {}

```

**Explanation:**
- Once a class is marked as `final`, Java will prevent any other class from inheriting from it.
- The `String` class is a well-known example of a `final` class in Java.

**Use Case:**
- **Immutability:** If you want a class to be immutable and its behavior unchanged, use the `final` keyword. For example, classes like `String` or `Integer` are `final` to preserve immutability and security.
- **Security:** Use `final` when you donâ€™t want other developers to override or modify the behavior of a class for security reasons.

### 2. Making All Constructors Private
You can make all the constructors of a class `private` to prevent it from being instantiated or subclassed. This technique effectively prevents subclassing because no other class will be able to call the `private` constructor to create an instance.
#### Example:
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor prevents subclassing
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```

**Explanation:**
- The `private` constructor ensures that no subclass can invoke the constructor of the superclass.
- This pattern is frequently used in singleton classes and utility classes (e.g., `java.lang.Math`) to prevent instantiation and subclassing.

**Use Case:**
- **Singleton Pattern:** When a class should only have a single instance, use `private` constructors to prevent subclassing and ensure only one instance exists.
- **Utility Classes:** Classes that contain static utility methods (e.g., `Math` or `Collections`) often have `private` constructors to prevent subclassing.

### 3. Using a Static Factory Method and a Private Constructor
In combination with a `private` constructor, you can use a static factory method to control the object creation. This technique not only prevents subclassing but also provides control over object instantiation.

#### Example:
```java
class DatabaseConnection {
    private DatabaseConnection() {
        // Prevents subclassing and external instantiation
    }

    public static DatabaseConnection getConnection() {
        return new DatabaseConnection();
    }
}

// Attempt to subclass will fail
// class MyDBConnection extends DatabaseConnection {} // Compilation error

```
**Explanation:**
- The `private` constructor ensures no subclassing.
- The static factory method controls the creation of instances and can also control the return of singleton or pooled instances.

**Use Case:**
- **Controlled Object Creation:** Use this method to control how objects are created and ensure the class can't be subclassed or instantiated incorrectly.

### 4. Sealing a Class in Java 17+ (Sealed Classes)
Starting from Java 17, you can use sealed classes to restrict subclassing to a specific set of permitted classes. This provides more fine-grained control than simply making the class `final`.

#### Example:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {
    // Base class can only be extended by Circle and Square
}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Class implementation
}

final class Square extends Shape {
    // Class implementation
}

// The following will cause a compilation error
// class Triangle extends Shape {} // Not permitted by the sealed class

```
**Explanation:**
- Sealed classes allow you to declare which specific classes are allowed to extend a base class.
- Any subclass of a sealed class must either be `final`, sealed, or non-sealed.

**Use Case:**
- **Security and Control:** Use sealed classes when you want to limit the possible hierarchy of classes and ensure only known, trusted classes extend the base class.

## Summary of Approaches:

- **`final` Keyword:** Prevents any subclassing; the class is completely final and cannot be extended.
- **Private Constructor:** Prevents any subclass from being created by preventing the constructor from being called.
- **Static Factory Method:** Provides controlled instantiation with a `private` constructor, preventing subclassing.
- **Sealed Classes (Java 17+):** Provides more granular control, allowing only specific subclasses to extend the class.

### When to Use Each Approach:
- Use `final` when you want a complete prevention of inheritance, such as with immutable or security-sensitive classes.
- Use a `private` constructor for utility or singleton classes where subclassing and instantiation should be restricted.
- Use sealed classes when you need more control over subclassing but still want to allow certain classes to extend.
