# 31. Which data type would you choose for storing currency values like Trading Price? Float, Double and BigDecimal?


## Using `BigDecimal` for Currency Values in Java

### Why `BigDecimal`?

For storing currency values, `BigDecimal` is the best choice compared to `float` or `double`. This is because `BigDecimal` offers high precision, which is critical when dealing with financial data such as trading prices. Letâ€™s explain why:

### Why Not `float` and `double`?

`float` and `double` are floating-point data types, but they suffer from rounding errors due to their internal binary representation. They are fast and memory-efficient but imprecise for financial calculations.

#### Example

```java
double price = 1.03 - 0.42;
System.out.println(price);  // Output: 0.6100000000000001 (Imprecision!)
```
Here, the precision issue arises because `float` and `double` cannot exactly represent decimal numbers, especially when dealing with currency.

### Why Use `BigDecimal`?

`BigDecimal` provides arbitrary-precision and controls rounding modes. It is accurate for calculations involving currency or precise measurements.

### Advantages of `BigDecimal`:
- Precision: BigDecimal provides exact precision and is particularly useful for financial calculations where rounding errors are unacceptable.

- Control: You have control over rounding modes, scale, and precision, ensuring that calculations are accurate.

- Immutable: Instances of BigDecimal are immutable, which means once created, their value cannot be changed. This helps prevent unintended modifications.

### Example

```java
BigDecimal price = new BigDecimal("1.03").subtract(new BigDecimal("0.42"));
System.out.println(price);  // Output: 0.61 (Precise!)
```

### When to Use Each:
- Use double when you need fast and approximate calculations (e.g., scientific computations).
- Use BigDecimal when precision is critical, such as for currency values, where rounding issues can cause significant financial errors.
