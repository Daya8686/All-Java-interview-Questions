# 07. How to make a class immutable in Java?

## Creating an Immutable Class in Java

An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified after creation. To create an immutable class in Java, follow these steps:

1. **Declare the Class as final**
   - Marking the class as `final` ensures that it cannot be subclassed, preventing inheritance-based modification.

2. **Make Fields final and private**
   - Mark all instance variables as `private` and `final`. This ensures they can only be initialized once through the constructor.

3. **Initialize Fields in the Constructor**
   - Provide a constructor that assigns values to the final fields. This is the only place where the fields can be assigned values.

4. **No Setters**
   - Do not provide any setter methods, as they would allow modification of the internal state after object creation.

5. **Ensure Deep Copy for Mutable Fields**
   - If the class contains fields that are references to mutable objects (like arrays, collections, or custom objects), return deep copies instead of returning references. This prevents external modification of the mutable fields.

```java
private final List<String> hobbies;

public ImmutableClass(String name, int age, List<String> hobbies) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.hobbies = new ArrayList<>(hobbies); // Deep copy
}

public List<String> getHobbies() {
    return new ArrayList<>(hobbies); // Return deep copy
}

```

6. **No clone() method**
   - Avoid providing a `clone()` method that could potentially allow the internal state to be modified.

### Example

```java
public final class Employee {
    private final String name; // Private and final field

    // Constructor to initialize the field
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method to access the private field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // No setters, ensuring immutability
    // No clone() method, preventing state modification
}
```
