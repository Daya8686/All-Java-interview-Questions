# 44. How Do You Handle InterruptedException?

## InterruptedException in Java

An `InterruptedException` is thrown when a thread is interrupted while it is waiting, sleeping, or otherwise occupied.

### Why Does It Occur?

- Threads can be interrupted using the `Thread.interrupt()` method.
- If a thread is sleeping or waiting and another thread interrupts it, the `InterruptedException` is thrown.

### Handling InterruptedException

There are two primary ways to handle an `InterruptedException`:

#### 1. Handle the Exception Gracefully:
- Use a `try-catch` block to handle the exception. This might involve cleanup, logging, or re-interrupting the thread.

**Example:**
```java
try {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Handle the interruption
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Preserve the interrupt status
    System.out.println("Thread was interrupted, Failed to complete operation");
}
```

#### 2. Propagate the Exception:

Sometimes, it's better to propagate the exception by adding a throws clause to the method and letting the calling method handle it.
```java

public void myMethod() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
```
#### Best Practice:
- Preserve the interrupt status by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` after catching the exception. This ensures that the interruption is not lost.
- Handle the interruption properly, especially if youâ€™re working with long-running threads or tasks that should stop gracefully when interrupted.
