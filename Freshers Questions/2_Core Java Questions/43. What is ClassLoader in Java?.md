# 43. What is ClassLoader in Java?

## ClassLoader in Java

A `ClassLoader` in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for loading classes into the JVM dynamically. It converts the class bytecode into an executable format and loads it into memory.

### Types of ClassLoaders:

1. **Bootstrap ClassLoader:**
   - **Role:** The root `ClassLoader`, responsible for loading core Java classes (`java.lang`, `java.util`, etc.) from the `rt.jar` file.
   - **Implementation:** It is implemented natively (in C or C++).

2. **Platform ClassLoader:**
   - **Role:** Loads classes from the extensions directory (`ext`), such as security extensions or extra Java libraries.
   - **Location:** It loads classes from the `lib/ext` folder.

3. **Application ClassLoader:**
   - **Role:** Loads classes from the application’s classpath, including JAR files and directories.
   - **Location:** Loads classes from the application's classpath (`CLASSPATH` environment variable).
   - **Usage:** Used for loading user-defined classes.

4. **Custom ClassLoader:**
   - **Role:** Developers can create custom class loaders by extending `ClassLoader`.
   - **Usage:** Useful for dynamic or non-standard class-loading needs (e.g., plugin systems).

### Hierarchy of ClassLoader in Java

`ClassLoader` in Java follows a delegation model. When a class is requested, the `ClassLoader` first delegates the request to its parent `ClassLoader`.

1. **Bootstrap ClassLoader:**
   - Loads the core classes.

2. **Extension (Platform) ClassLoader:**
   - If not found by the Bootstrap ClassLoader, the Extension ClassLoader is asked to load the class.

3. **Application ClassLoader:**
   - Finally, the Application ClassLoader is used to load classes from the application’s classpath.

### Use Cases

1. **Custom ClassLoaders:**
   - Developers can create custom ClassLoaders to load classes in a specific manner, such as loading classes from a network or encrypted file.

2. **Dynamic Class Loading:**
   - Classes can be loaded dynamically at runtime based on specific conditions.

### Example

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
System.out.println(classLoader);
```
