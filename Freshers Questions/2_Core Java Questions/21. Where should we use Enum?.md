# 21. Where should we use Enum?

## When to Use Enums in Java

Enums in Java are used to define a set of named constants. They are a special type of class that ensures type safety and are particularly useful when you have a variable that can take only one out of a small set of possible values.

### Use Cases for Enums

1. **Fixed Set of Constants**:
   - Use enums when you have a fixed set of related constants, such as the days of the week (`SUNDAY, MONDAY`), directions (`NORTH, SOUTH`), or statuses (`SUCCESS, FAILURE`).

2. **Type-Safe Constants**:
   - Enums provide type safety. Instead of using `int` constants or `String` literals (which are error-prone), enums restrict the allowed values to a specific set.

3. **Switch Case Compatibility**:
   - Enums can be used in switch-case statements, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.

4. **Method Implementation**:
   - Enums can have methods, fields, and constructors, so they can implement behavior as well as define constants.

5. **State Representation**:
   - Enums are useful for representing a state with a predefined set of possible values, like user roles (`ADMIN, USER`) or HTTP response codes (`OK, NOT_FOUND`).

6. **Singletons and Thread Safety**:
   - Enums load only once when the class is first loaded in the class loader.
   - Enums can be used to create immutable Enum objects and Singleton classes. This is thread-safe by default, so no specific synchronization is required.
   - Singleton created with enum cannot be broken in any case.

### Example

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
```
