# 03. What is JIT compiler in Java?


## Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)

### Just-In-Time Compilation
JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler translates bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving performance by compiling code only when it's needed.

### Improves Performance
It optimizes performance by converting frequently executed bytecode into native code, which can be executed more efficiently.

### Works with JVM
The JIT compiler is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and works after the program is loaded and executed in the JVM.

### Dynamic Optimization
The JIT compiler performs dynamic optimization by analyzing code paths during execution and optimizing the frequently used ones.

### Code Caching
It caches the compiled code, allowing it to reuse compiled machine code for faster subsequent executions.
