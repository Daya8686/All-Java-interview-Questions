# 64. What are the Differences Between C++ and Java?

## Comparison Between C++ and Java

| **Aspect**               | **C++**                                          | **Java**                                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Dependency**  | Platform-dependent (compiled to machine code)    | Platform-independent (compiled to bytecode, runs on JVM)      |
| **Memory Management**    | Manual memory management (using pointers, `new`, `delete`) | Automatic memory management via garbage collection            |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Supports multiple inheritance (with classes and interfaces) | Doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes (only interfaces) |
| **Pointers**             | Supports pointers (direct memory manipulation)   | Doesn’t support pointers (handles memory indirectly)          |
| **Operator Overloading** | Supports operator overloading                    | Doesn’t support operator overloading                          |
| **Templates / Generics** | Templates for generic programming                | Generics for type-safe programming                            |
| **Header Files**         | Requires header files for declarations           | No header files, all code is in `.java` files                  |
| **Object-Oriented**      | Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming | Purely object-oriented, but with primitive types             |
| **Compilation**          | Compiled to platform-specific binaries           | Compiled to bytecode, executed on the JVM                     |
| **Memory Access**        | Manual use of memory addresses via pointers      | No direct memory access                                       |
