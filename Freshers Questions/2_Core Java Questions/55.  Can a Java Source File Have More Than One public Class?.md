# 55.  Can a Java Source File Have More Than One public Class?

## Can a Java Source File Have More Than One `public` Class?

No, a Java source file cannot have more than one `public` class.

### Reason:
- **One Public Class Rule:** If a class is declared `public`, it must be the only public class in the file, and the file name must match the name of the public class.
- **Compile-Time Error:** If more than one public class is declared in a file, the compiler will throw an error.
- **Other Classes:** You can have other non-public classes (default, private, or protected) in the same source file, but only one public class.
- **File Naming Convention:** The name of the source file must exactly match the name of the public class in it.

### Example:
```java
// File: Car.java
public class Car { }  // This class name matches the file name

class Engine { }  // Other classes can be present but not public
```

#### Why:
- The restriction ensures clarity and consistency during the compilation process, making it easier to locate and manage classes in large projects.
