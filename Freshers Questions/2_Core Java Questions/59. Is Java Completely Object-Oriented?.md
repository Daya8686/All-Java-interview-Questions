# 59. Is Java Completely Object-Oriented?


## Is Java Completely Object-Oriented?

No, Java is not completely object-oriented. Although Java is a strongly object-oriented language, there are a few elements that prevent it from being fully object-oriented:

### Reasons:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   - Java has eight primitive data types (`int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) that are not objects. These primitives provide performance benefits but deviate from pure object orientation.
   - In a completely object-oriented language, everything, including data types, would be objects.

2. **Static Methods:**
   - Static methods can be invoked without creating an object, which is another departure from the object-oriented model.

3. **null Value:**
   - The `null` literal in Java represents the absence of a reference and is not an object itself.

### Summary:
Java balances between performance (by using primitives) and object-oriented principles. To make primitives behave like objects, Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`), but the existence of primitives means Java is not purely object-oriented.
