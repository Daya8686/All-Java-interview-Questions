# 34. What are types of inner classes in Java?


### Inner Classes in Java

Inner classes in Java are classes defined within another class. They are primarily used for logical grouping and to access the private members of the enclosing class. Letâ€™s dive into the types of inner classes, their characteristics, scope, memory usage, and practical examples.

#### Types of Inner Classes
1. Non-Static Inner Class (Regular Inner Class)
2. Static Nested Class
3. Local Inner Class
4. Anonymous Inner Class

#### 1. Non-Static Inner Class (Regular Inner Class)
**Definition:** A class declared inside another class without the `static` keyword.

**Key Points:**
- **Access:** Can access all members (including private) of the outer class.
- **Instance of Outer Required:** Yes, an instance of the outer class is required to create an instance of a non-static inner class.
- **Scope:** Scoped to the outer class.
- **Memory:** Dependent on the outer class instance. When the outer class is destroyed, the inner class instance is also destroyed.
- **Use Cases:** Frequently used when the inner class needs to operate on the instance of the outer class.

**Example:**
```java
class Outer {
    private String message = "Hello from Outer Class";

    class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message); // Access private member
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner(); // Create using outer instance
        inner.display();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Static Nested Class
**Definition:** A static class defined within another class.

**Key Points:**
- **Access:** Can only access static members of the outer class. Cannot directly access instance members.
- **Instance of Outer Required:** No, can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.
- **Scope:** Scoped to the outer class.
- **Memory:** Does not require an instance of the outer class, hence is independent.
- **Use Cases:** Useful for grouping helper or utility classes related to the outer class.

**Example:**
```java
class Outer {
    private static String message = "Static message from Outer Class";

    static class StaticNested {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message); // Access static member
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer.StaticNested nested = new Outer.StaticNested(); // Direct instantiation
        nested.display();
    }
}
```

`Outer$StaticNested.class`

### Local Inner Class
**Definition:** A class defined inside a block, such as a method or constructor.

**Key Points:**
- **Access:** Can access final or effectively final variables of the enclosing block.
- **Instance of Outer Required:** Yes, but implicitly provided when called from the outer class.
- **Scope:** Limited to the block in which it is defined.
- **Memory:** Exists only during the execution of the block where it is defined.
- **Use Cases:** Useful for encapsulating logic within a specific method or block.

**Example:**
```java
class Outer {
    void display() {
        String localVariable = "Local Inner Class";

        class LocalInner {
            void print() {
                System.out.println(localVariable); // Access final or effectively final variable
            }
        }

        LocalInner inner = new LocalInner();
        inner.print();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.display();
    }
}
```
**.class Files**
`Outer$1LocalInner.class` (Number depends on the sequence of `anonymous/local classes`).
### Anonymous Inner Class
**Definition:** A class without a name, defined and instantiated simultaneously, usually to implement an interface or extend a class.

**Key Points:**
- **Access:** Can access final or effectively final variables of the enclosing scope.
- **Instance of Outer Required:** Yes, if defined inside a non-static method.
- **Scope:** Exists only in the location where it is defined.
- **Memory:** Created only when required.
- **Use Cases:** Simplifies code for short-lived implementations, e.g., event listeners, callbacks, or simple logic.

**Example:**
```java
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting greeting = new Greeting() { // Anonymous class implementing Greeting
            @Override
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello from Anonymous Inner Class!");
            }
        };
        greeting.sayHello();
    }
}
```

## Comparison Table

| Type                | Access                       | Instance of Outer Required | Scope          | Memory                     | Use Cases                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Non-Static Inner    | All outer members            | Yes                        | Outer class    | Dependent on outer instance| Operating on outer instance           |
| Static Nested       | Static outer members         | No                         | Outer class    | Independent                | Utility/helper functionality          |
| Local Inner         | Final/effectively final locals | Implicit                  | Enclosing block| Limited to block           | Encapsulated method logic             |
| Anonymous Inner     | Final/effectively final locals | Implicit                  | Single-use location | Created when needed        | Event listeners, callbacks            |

## Key Points on `.class` Files

- Each inner class generates a separate `.class` file.
- **Syntax:** `Outer$Inner.class`, `Outer$StaticNested.class`, etc.
- Anonymous classes are numbered sequentially, e.g., `Outer$1.class`.

## When to Use Inner Classes?

- **Non-static Inner Class:** When the inner class logically belongs to the instance of the outer class.
- **Static Nested Class:** For utility or helper classes that don't need a reference to the outer class instance.
- **Local Inner Class:** For tightly scoped logic within a method or block.
- **Anonymous Inner Class:** For quick, one-off implementations.
