# 40.  What is the Difference Between Static and Instance Variables?

## Static vs. Instance Variables in Java

### Static Variables
- **Class-Level Variables:** A `static` variable belongs to the class, not to any specific object.
```java
static int counter;
```
- **Shared Among All Objects:** All instances of the class share the same copy of a `static` variable. Changes made to the variable reflect across all objects.
```java
class Car {
    static int totalCars = 0;
    Car() { totalCars++; }
}
```
- **Memory Allocation:** Static variables are stored in the method area and allocated once when the class is loaded into memory.
- **Access:** Static variables can be accessed using the class name or directly in static blocks/methods.
```java
Car.totalCars;
```
- **Usage:** Used when a value is to be shared across all objects of the class (e.g., a counter of how many instances have been created).

### Instance Variables
- **Object-Level Variables:** An instance variable belongs to a specific object of the class.
```java
String model;
```
- **Separate for Each Object:** Each object of the class has its own copy of the instance variable. Changes made in one object do not affect others.
```java
Car c1 = new Car();
c1.model = "Sedan";
```
- **Memory Allocation:** Instance variables are stored in the heap memory, allocated for each object when the object is created.
- **Access:** Instance variables are accessed using object references.
```java
System.out.println(c1.model);
```
- **Usage:** Used to represent the state of an object (e.g., name, age).

### Static Block
- Static variables can be accessed directly in a `static` block because both are class-level entities.
- Instance variables cannot be accessed directly in a `static` block because they belong to instances.

### Comparison Table

| **Feature**         | **Static Variables**                                   | **Instance Variables**                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Belong to the class (shared across all objects).       | Belong to individual objects (unique to each object).  |
| **Declaration**     | Declared with the `static` keyword.                    | Declared without the `static` keyword.                 |
| **Memory Allocation** | Allocated once when the class is loaded in memory.   | Allocated each time a new object is created.           |
| **Access**          | Accessed using the class name or instance.             | Accessed only via an object.                           |
| **Scope**           | Shared across all instances of the class.              | Specific to a single instance.                         |
| **Example**         | `static int count;`                                    | `int id;`                                              |
| **Use Case**        | Common/shared data (e.g., counters).                   | Object-specific data (e.g., user details).             |

### Example Code:

```java

class Example {
    static int staticVar = 10; // Static variable
    int instanceVar = 20;      // Instance variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example();
        Example obj2 = new Example();

        obj1.instanceVar = 30;
        Example.staticVar = 40;

        System.out.println(obj1.instanceVar); // 30 (unique to obj1)
        System.out.println(obj2.instanceVar); // 20 (unique to obj2)
        System.out.println(Example.staticVar); // 40 (shared)
    }
}
```
