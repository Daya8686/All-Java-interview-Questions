# 57. What is Casting?


## Casting in Java

### Definition:
Casting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another. There are two types of casting: implicit casting (widening) and explicit casting (narrowing).

### Types of Casting:

1. **Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion):**
   - **Description:** This occurs when a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger data type. It is done implicitly by Java because there is no risk of data loss.
   - **Example:** Converting an `int` to a `long`.
   ```java
   int num = 10;
   long bigNum = num;  // Implicit casting
```

### Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion)

This occurs when a larger data type is explicitly converted to a smaller data type. It requires manual casting because there is a risk of data loss.

**Example: Converting a `double` to an `int`**
```java
double a = 10.5;
int b = (int) a;  // Explicit casting (data loss occurs: 10.5 -> 10)
```
#### Use Case:
- Casting is commonly used when you need to convert objects or primitives from one type to another, especially in scenarios where precision (widening) or type conversions (narrowing) are required.
