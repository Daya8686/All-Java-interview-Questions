# 56. What is the purpose of generics?


## Generics in Java

### Definition:
Generics in Java are a feature that allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters, providing compile-time type safety. It ensures that you can use the same code with different types while maintaining type-checking at compile time.

### Purpose of Generics:

1. **Type Safety:**
   - Generics ensure that type errors are caught at compile time, which reduces runtime errors and makes code more robust.
   - **Example:** In a `List<String>`, only `String` objects can be added, preventing type mismatch issues.

2. **Code Reusability:**
   - Generics allow you to write a single method or class that can be used with different data types, enhancing code reusability.
   - **Example:** A `List<T>` can be used to store elements of any type (`T`), making it reusable for different types.

3. **Eliminates Type Casting:**
   - With generics, you don't need to cast when retrieving elements from a collection, which makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.
   - **Example:** Without generics, when retrieving an object from a non-generic list, you must cast it back to its original type.

4. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - By specifying types explicitly, generics improve code readability and maintainability.
   - **Example:** `List<String>` is easier to understand than `List` where the type is unclear.

### Example:
```java
// Generic Class
class Box<T> {
    private T value;
    
    public void set(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public T get() {
        return value;
    }
}

// Usage
Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
intBox.set(123);  // Type-safe

Box<String> strBox = new Box<>();
strBox.set("Hello");  // Type-safe
```

Generics ensure type safety while allowing flexibility in the types that can be used, making the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
