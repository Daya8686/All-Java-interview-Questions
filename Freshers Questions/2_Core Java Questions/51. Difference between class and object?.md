# 51. Difference between class and object?

## Class vs. Object

### Definition:
- **Class:** A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and methods.
- **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific, concrete entity that has its own unique state (values of attributes) and can invoke methods defined in the class.

### Key Differences:

#### Nature:
- **Class:** Conceptual or logical construct. It defines the structure and behavior of objects but is not tangible.
- **Object:** A real, tangible instance created from the class. It holds actual data in memory.

#### Memory Allocation:
- **Class:** No memory is allocated until an object is created. A class just defines the structure and methods.
- **Object:** Memory is allocated to store the data (fields) when an object is instantiated using the `new` keyword.

#### Creation:
- **Class:** Created using the `class` keyword.
- **Object:** Created using the `new` keyword (for instance creation).

#### Relationship:
- **Class:** Acts as a blueprint.
- **Object:** Is the entity built based on the blueprint.

### Examples:

- **Class:** A `Car` class defines the attributes (model, year) and methods (drive, stop).
- **Object:** The actual instance of the class with its own state and behavior.
```java
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020); // creates an object myCar from the Car class.
```
