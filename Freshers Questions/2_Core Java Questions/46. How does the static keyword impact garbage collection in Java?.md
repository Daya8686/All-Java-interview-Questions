# 46. How does the static keyword impact garbage collection in Java?

## Static Members and Garbage Collection in Java

Static members (variables or methods) are associated with the class, not with individual objects. Therefore, they live in the method area (part of JVM memory) and are not tied to object instances.

### Impact on Garbage Collection:
- **Static variables are not eligible for garbage collection** as long as the class they belong to is loaded in the JVM. These variables are cleared only when the class is unloaded (which generally happens at JVM shutdown).
- Since static variables are not tied to objects, the garbage collector does not reclaim memory for static variables even if all objects of the class are garbage-collected.
- **Objects referenced by static variables remain in memory** even if all instances of the class are no longer reachable, leading to memory leaks if not handled carefully.

### Summary:
- **Static variables are not garbage collected** like instance variables.
- Memory used by static variables **persists throughout the lifecycle of the JVM**.
