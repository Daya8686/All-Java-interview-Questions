# 52. What is method overloading?


## Method Overloading in Java

### Definition:
Method Overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or order of parameters). It provides a way to implement polymorphism (specifically compile-time polymorphism) in Java.

### Purpose:
The purpose of method overloading is to improve the readability and reusability of code by allowing the same method to perform similar tasks with different input parameters.

### How It Works:
- **Method Signature:** Method overloading happens based on the method signature, which includes the method name and the parameter list (type and number of parameters).
  - The return type can be different, but it is not considered part of the method signature for overloading.

### Rules:
1. **Different Number of Parameters:**
   - You can overload methods by changing the number of parameters.

   ```java
    void display(int a);
    void display(int a, int b);
    ```
2. **Different Parameter Types:**
   - You can overload methods by changing the type of parameters.

  ```java
      void display(int a);
      void display(String a);
  ```
   
3. **Order of Parameters:**
   - Changing the order of parameters is also a valid way to overload a method.
    ```java
    void display(int a, String b);
    void display(String b, int a);

    ```

### Use Case:
- **Constructors:** Overloading is commonly used in constructors to allow different ways of initializing an object.
```java
public class Car {
    Car(String model) { ... }
    Car(String model, int year) { ... }
}

```

### When to Use:
- When you want a method to handle different types or numbers of arguments while providing similar functionality (e.g., multiple ways to print, multiple ways to initialize an object).
