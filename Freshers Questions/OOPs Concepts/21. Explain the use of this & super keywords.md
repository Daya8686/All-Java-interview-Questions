# 21. Explain the use of this & super keywords?

## Usage of `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword in Java refers to the current instance of the class. It is used in various scenarios:

### Referencing Current Instance Variables
When local variables have the same name as instance variables, `this` is used to distinguish between them.

```java
class Employee {
    private String name;
    
    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name; // `this` refers to the current instance's name variable
    }
}
```
### Calling another constructor in the same class:

```java

class Employee {
    Employee() {
        this("John Doe"); // calls the parameterized constructor
    }
    
    Employee(String name) {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```
### Returning the current instance from a method (method chaining):

```java

class Employee {
    Employee setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this;
    }
}
```
## Usage of `super` Keyword

The `super` keyword in Java refers to the parent class (superclass) and is used to access methods and constructors of the parent class.

### Calling a Superclass Constructor

When a subclass constructor needs to call a constructor of its superclass, it uses the `super` keyword.

```java
class Person {
    Person(String name) {
        System.out.println("Person: " + name);
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    Employee(String name) {
        super(name); // Calls the constructor of Person class
    }
}
```
### Accessing a method of the superclass that is overridden in the subclass:

```java

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // Calls the method in Animal
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
#### Usage Summary:

- `this` refers to the current object/instance.
- `super` refers to the parent class, often used to call the superclass's constructor or methods.
