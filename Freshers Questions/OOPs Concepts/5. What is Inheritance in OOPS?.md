## 5. What is Inheritance in OOPS?

## Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance is a key OOP feature that allows a new class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties (attributes) and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a class hierarchy.

### Types of Inheritance

- **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one parent class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a parent class, which itself is derived from another parent class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple classes inherit from one parent class.
- **Note:** Java does not support multiple inheritance directly to avoid ambiguity but supports it through interfaces.

### Example

```java
class Animal {  
    void eat() {  
        System.out.println("This animal is eating.");  
    }  
}  

class Dog extends Animal {  // Inheriting Animal class
    void bark() {  
        System.out.println("The dog is barking.");  
    }  
}

public class TestInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();  // Calling inherited method
        dog.bark(); // Calling subclass method
    }
}
```
## Advantages of Inheritance

- **Code Reusability:** Common functionalities in parent classes can be reused in child classes.
- **Extensibility:** Child classes can extend the behavior of parent classes without modifying the original class.
- **Polymorphism Support:** Inheritance allows for polymorphic behavior, where a parent class reference can hold the child class objects.
