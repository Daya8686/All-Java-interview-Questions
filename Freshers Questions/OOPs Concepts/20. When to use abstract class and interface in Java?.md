# 20. When to use abstract class and interface in Java?

## When to Use Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

### Use an Abstract Class When:
- You want to share common functionality between related classes but also allow subclasses to have their specific implementations.
- You need a base class with common state (fields) and behavior (methods) that subclasses can inherit.

**Example:**
An abstract class `Vehicle` that has both concrete methods like `startEngine()` and abstract methods like `move()` for different types of vehicles.

### Use an Interface When:
- You want to define a contract that unrelated classes must follow, without concerning yourself with how they implement that contract.
- You need to achieve multiple inheritance of behavior, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.

**Example:**
Interfaces like `Runnable`, `Callable`, or `Comparable` define behaviors that various classes can implement, regardless of their actual hierarchy.

### Guideline:
- **Use abstract classes** when there is shared functionality with some common state/behavior.
- **Use interfaces** when you need a flexible contract that allows for multiple inheritance and loose coupling.
