## Polymorphism in OOPS

Polymorphism is an OOP feature that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides the ability to define one interface and have multiple implementations. In simple terms, polymorphism allows one method to behave differently based on the object that calls it.

### Types of Polymorphism in Java

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**
2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**

### 1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

- **Definition:** Occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (method signature). The method that gets invoked is determined at compile time. Method Overloading can be done in the same class as well as different classes.
- **Method Overloading:** A process where the number, type, or arrangement of parameters must be different.
  - Number of parameters must be different.
              or  
  - Type of parameters must be different.
              or
  - Arrangement of parameters must be different.
- **Example of Compile-time Polymorphism:**

```java
class Calculator {
    // Method Overloading
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
public class TestOverloading {
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));         // Output: 5
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3, 4));      // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Key Points:

- The method signature (number or type of parameters) determines which method will be invoked.
- It is determined at compile-time.

### Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):

- Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method to be called is determined at runtime.
- Method Overriding is an example of run-time polymorphism.

### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    // Method to be overridden
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method overriding
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class TestPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();  // Polymorphism in action
        myAnimal.sound();             // Output: Dog barks

        myAnimal = a new Cat();
        myAnimal.sound();             // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```
### Key Points:

- Run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
- The exact method that gets invoked is determined at runtime based on the object type.

### Advantages of Polymorphism:

- **Code Reusability:** The same method name can be used for different types of objects, increasing code reuse.
- **Flexibility:** Polymorphism allows developers to introduce new classes with minimal impact on the existing system.
- **Extensibility:** Systems can grow over time, as new classes can easily be added with overridden methods, which will work with the existing system.
- **Loose Coupling:** Using polymorphism, objects are loosely coupled, which leads to more flexible and maintainable code.
