# 1. What is OOPS?

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to design and develop applications.
Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity. 
This approach aims to enhance modularity, reusability, and maintainability by organizing software around real-world entities rather than functions and logic.

### Key Concepts

- **Classes:** Blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects.
- **Objects:** Instances of classes. Objects contain data (in fields) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.
- **Methodologies:** OOP allows the breaking down of complex problems into smaller, manageable objects which can be reused.
