## Difference Between Overloading and Overriding

| Feature                          | Overloading                                                                         | Overriding                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                   | Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists in the same class. | Redefining a method of the superclass in the subclass with the same signature (name and parameters). |
| **Method Signature**             | Methods must have the same name but different parameters (type, number, or both).   | The method signature (name and parameters) must be exactly the same as the superclass method.           |
| **Return Type**                  | Can have the same or different return types.                                         | Must have the same return type or a subtype (covariant return).                                         |
| **Access Modifiers**             | No restrictions on access modifiers; can be anything.                                | Cannot reduce the visibility (e.g., public cannot be overridden with private).                         |
| **Static/Instance**              | Can be applied to both static and instance methods.                                  | Only applies to instance methods (not static).                                                         |
| **Inheritance**                  | Overloading can occur within the same class or across subclasses.                    | Overriding requires inheritance, meaning the subclass must override a method from its superclass.    |
| **Binding**                      | Compile-time (early binding).                                                        | Run-time (late binding).                                                                                |
| **Keywords (final/static/private)**| Can overload final, static, or private methods.                                      | Cannot override final, static, or private methods.                                                      |
| **Purpose**                      | To provide multiple ways to perform similar tasks based on different input parameters. | To modify the behavior of an inherited method for the subclass.                                          |

### Example (Overloading):

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Example (Overriding):

```java

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```
