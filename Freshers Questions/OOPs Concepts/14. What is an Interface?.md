# 14. What is an Interface?

## Interface in Java

### Definition

An interface in Java is a blueprint for a class. It contains only abstract methods (until Java 7) 
and default or static methods (from Java 8 onwards). All methods in an interface are implicitly
public and abstract (except static and default methods). Interfaces are implemented by classes, 
allowing them to inherit abstract methods and provide their implementation.

### Key Points

- Cannot have instance variables; only constants (implicitly public, static, final).
- Supports multiple inheritance in Java, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- Can have default and static methods (from Java 8 onwards) with method bodies.
- All methods are implicitly public and abstract (unless static/default).

### Example

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();   // Abstract method (implicitly public and abstract)
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class TestInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```
