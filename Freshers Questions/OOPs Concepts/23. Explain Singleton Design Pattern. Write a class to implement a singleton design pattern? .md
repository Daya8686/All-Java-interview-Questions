# 23. Explain Singleton Design Pattern. Write a class to implement a singleton design pattern?

- There are 6 types of singleton design patterns here we are focusing only one...
- Remaining we can see in different set of interview questions

### One of the way to implement Singleton Design Pattern

### 1. Eager Initialization Singleton
In this approach, the instance is created at the time of class loading. This is a straightforward and thread-safe method, but it does not allow for lazy initialization.

#### Example:
```java

public class EagerSingleton {
    // Create instance at the time of class loading
    private static final EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();

    private EagerSingleton() {}

    public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- **Pros:** Simple and thread-safe.
- **Cons:** The instance is created even if it is never used, which could waste resources.
