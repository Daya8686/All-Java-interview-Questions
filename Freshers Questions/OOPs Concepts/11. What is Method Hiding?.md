# 11. What is Method Hiding?

## Method Hiding in Java

Method hiding occurs when a static method in a subclass has the same signature as a static method in its superclass. Instead of overriding, the subclass method hides the superclass method. Method hiding applies only to static methods, as instance methods follow overriding rules.

### Key Characteristics

- Both methods must be static.
- The method in the subclass does not override the superclass method; it hides it.
- Method calls are resolved based on the reference type (class), not the object type.

### Example

```java
class Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}

public class TestMethodHiding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent parent = new Parent();
        Parent child = new Child();  // Parent reference to Child object
        parent.display();            // Output: Parent display
        child.display();             // Output: Parent display (method hiding)
    }
}
```

### Important:
 - Even though the object is of Child, the method of Parent class is called because the method is static and resolved at compile-time based on the reference type, not the actual object.
