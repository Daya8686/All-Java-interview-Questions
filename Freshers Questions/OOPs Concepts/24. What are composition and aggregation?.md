# 24. What are composition and aggregation?


## Composition in Object-Oriented Programming

Composition is a type of HAS-A relationship where one class contains or is composed of other objects. It represents a strong association where one class cannot exist without the other. If the container (or parent) object is destroyed, the contained (or child) objects are also destroyed.

### Example

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts.");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // Car "has a" Engine (Composition)

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car starts.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Car` is composed of `Engine`. If the `Car` is destroyed, the `Engine` is also destroyed.

### Aggregation
- **Definition:** 
  - Weak association where the contained object can exist independently of the container.
  - The lifecycle of the child object is not dependent on the parent.

**Example:**
```java
class Address {
    String city;
    
    Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class Person {
    private Address address; // Person "has a" Address (Aggregation)

    Person(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }
}
```
Here, `Person` aggregates `Address`. The `Address` object can exist independently of the `Person` object. If the `Person` object is destroyed, the `Address` object may still exist.

### Key Difference

- In **composition**, the child object cannot exist independently, while in **aggregation**, the child can exist independently.
