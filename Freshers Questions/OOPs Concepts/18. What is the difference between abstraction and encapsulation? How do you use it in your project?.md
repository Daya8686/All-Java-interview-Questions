# 18. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation? How do you use it in your project?

## Abstraction and Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstraction

**Definition:**
Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object can do rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

**Example:**
In a banking application, a user only interacts with high-level actions like `withdraw()` and `deposit()`. They don’t need to know the internal logic of how the bank processes these actions.

**How to Use Abstraction:**
- **Abstract Classes:** Define common functionality that subclasses share but may implement differently.
- **Interfaces:** Define a contract for what actions a class must perform, without specifying how the actions are implemented.

**In Your Project:**
In your Spring Boot project, abstraction can be used when defining service layers (Service interfaces) that contain business logic methods. The actual implementations of these services are hidden from controllers that call these services, promoting loose coupling between layers.

### Encapsulation

**Definition:**
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is done by making attributes private and providing public getter/setter methods to control access.

**Example:**
A class `Employee` has private fields like `name`, `salary`, and `age`. Access to these fields is provided through public methods like `getName()`, `setName()`, `getSalary()`, etc.

**How to Use Encapsulation:**
- Declare class variables as private.
- Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update the values of private variables.
- Ensure that direct access to the class’s internal data is controlled and safe.

**In Your Project:**
You might encapsulate sensitive data, such as user credentials or account information, inside classes by making these fields private and using getter/setter methods to prevent unauthorized or unintended modifications.
For example, you have used to create the POJO's and as well as Entity classes by which you can control the access to fileds direclty.

### Key Differences

| Aspect       | Abstraction                                                | Encapsulation                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**  | Hides implementation details to show only essential functionalities | Hides internal data and restricts access through public methods |
| **How Achieved** | Using abstract classes and interfaces                      | Using private variables and public getter/setter methods |
| **Focus**    | Focuses on what an object does                              | Focuses on how the object’s data is protected     |
| **Example**  | Service interface with abstract methods                    | Class with private fields and getter/setter methods |

### Summary

- **Abstraction:** Hides implementation details and shows only the essential functionality. It is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects an object’s data by restricting direct access to it, using private fields and public getter/setter methods.
- **How Used in Your Project:** Abstraction in service layers and encapsulation for protecting sensitive user or business data.
