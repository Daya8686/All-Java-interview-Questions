# 9 What is meant by dynamic polymorphism?

## Dynamic Polymorphism (Run-time Polymorphism)

### Definition

Dynamic polymorphism is where the method to be executed is determined at runtime, based on the actual object (not the reference type). It allows a method to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it.

### How it Occurs

- **Method Overriding:** A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. When an overridden method is called on a superclass reference, the JVM determines the appropriate method to invoke based on the actual object.

### Example

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class TestDynamicPoly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();  // Parent reference to child object
        animal.sound();             // Output: Dog barks (runtime resolution)
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- Dynamic polymorphism is lazy: The method to be executed is determined during runtime, which allows for late binding.
- More flexible, but slightly slower due to runtime overhead of method resolution.
- Works with inheritance and overriding, promoting runtime flexibility and adaptability.
