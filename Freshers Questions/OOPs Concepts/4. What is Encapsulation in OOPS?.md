## Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and the methods (functions) that manipulate that data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which can be achieved using access specifiers (like `private`, `protected`, `public`).

### Access Control

Encapsulation allows you to control who can access what data. For example, in Java, variables are often made `private` and accessed via public getter and setter methods.

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;  // Private variable cannot be accessed directly outside this class

    public String getName() {  // Public getter method
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {  // Public setter method
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```
## Advantages of Encapsulation

- **Data Protection:** Prevents unauthorized access to class fields, enhancing security.
- **Improved Maintainability:** As class internals are hidden, changing the internal logic does not affect other parts of the program that rely on the class.
- **Controlled Access:** Using methods like getters and setters, you can control how the class's fields are accessed or modified.
