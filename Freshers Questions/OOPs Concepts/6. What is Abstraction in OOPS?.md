## Abstraction in OOPS

Abstraction is an OOP concept where only the essential details of an object are shown to the user, while the inner workings are hidden. The primary goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by avoiding the display of unnecessary information, focusing only on relevant details. It allows a user to interact with the object without knowing the underlying implementation.

### Abstraction in Java

- **Achieved Using:** Abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Abstract Class

- A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Subclasses of the abstract class are responsible for providing implementations for the abstract methods.

#### Interface

- A completely abstract class that contains only method declarations (no method bodies). Classes that implement an interface must provide implementations for all its methods.

### Example (Using an Abstract Class):

```java
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void draw();

    // Concrete method
    void displayShapeName() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class TestAbstraction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Circle();  // Abstraction in action
        shape.draw();                // Output: Drawing a circle
        shape.displayShapeName();    // Output: This is a shape
    }
}
```
### Example (Using an Interface):

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();  // Abstract method by default in an interface
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key");
    }
}

class TestInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.start();  // Output: Car starts with a key
    }
}
```
## Key Benefits of Abstraction

- **Simplifies Code Management:** By abstracting unnecessary details, abstraction helps in focusing on higher-level logic.
- **Enhances Maintainability:** Changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect external code using the abstracted class.
- **Improves Security:** Hides the implementation details, preventing unintended misuse or modification.
- **Modularity:** Separates interface from implementation, promoting modular design.
