# 17. Why are default methods allowed in interfaces?

## Default Methods in Java

### Definition

Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to provide backward compatibility and enhanced flexibility for interfaces without breaking existing code. Before Java 8, adding new methods to an interface would break all classes that implemented it, because those classes would need to provide implementations for the new methods.

### Reasons for Allowing Default Methods

- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Before Java 8, adding new methods to an interface required changes to all implementing classes. With default methods, new methods can be added to interfaces without affecting existing implementations.

- **Multiple Inheritance of Behavior:**
  - Default methods allow interfaces to have concrete methods (with a body) that provide default behavior, while still enabling a class to override them if needed. This enhances code reuse.

- **Functional Programming Support:**
  - With the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8, default methods allow interfaces like `java.util.function` to define functional operations without the need for abstract classes.

### Example

```java
interface Printable {
    default void print() {
        System.out.println("Default print method");
    }
    
    void show();
}

class Document implements Printable {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Showing document");
    }
}

public class TestDefaultMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.print();  // Output: Default print method
        doc.show();   // Output: Showing document
    }
}
```

### Conclusion: 
- Default methods in interfaces provide greater flexibility, promote backward compatibility, and facilitate a smoother adoption of new features in Java.
