## 3. What are the main features of OOPs?

## Four Main Features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Encapsulation

- **Definition:** Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object.
And fields are accessed with setter and getter methods.
- **Example:** In a class `Car`, the data (`speed`, `fuelLevel`) and behavior (`accelerate()`, `brake()`) are encapsulated together.

### Inheritance

- **Definition:** A mechanism where one class (child or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass).
- **Example:** A class `Dog` can inherit from a class `Animal`, where `Dog` gets access to methods like `breathe()` from `Animal`.

### Polymorphism

- **Definition:** The ability of objects to take on many forms, specifically where a method can behave differently based on the object that calls it.
It is containing with method overloading and method overriding.
- **Example:** A parent class method `speak()` can be overridden by subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` to provide species-specific implementations.

### Abstraction

- **Definition:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In this methods can be Concrete Methods and Abstract methods.
Abstract methods are the method which does not provide method implementation or no method body.
Concrete methods are the method which provide method implementation, contains login in method.
- **Example:** When you use a `Car` object, you donâ€™t need to know the internal workings of its engine to drive it.
