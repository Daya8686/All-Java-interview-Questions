# 22. What is the ‘IS-A’ relationship in OOPs Java?

## The ‘IS-A’ Relationship in Java

The ‘IS-A’ relationship in Java refers to inheritance, where a subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of a superclass. It is also known as generalization or subclassing, which represents that one class is a specialized version of another.

### Achieving IS-A Relationship

The IS-A relationship is achieved using the `extends` keyword (for class inheritance) or `implements` keyword (for interface implementation).

### Example

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Dog IS-A Animal`. This means that the `Dog` class is a specialized type of `Animal`, inheriting its properties and methods.

### Usage

It promotes code reusability and logical hierarchy, allowing child classes to inherit common behavior from parent classes.
