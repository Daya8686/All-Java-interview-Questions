# 12 What is Variable Hiding?

## Variable Hiding in Java

Variable hiding occurs when a subclass defines a field with the same name as a field in its superclass. In this case, the field in the subclass hides the field in the superclass. Field hiding is similar to method hiding but applies to variables instead of methods.

### Key Characteristics

- Field names in both superclass and subclass are the same.
- Field hiding applies to both instance and static fields.
- Access to fields depends on the reference type (class) at compile-time.

### Example

```java
class Parent {
    String name = "Parent";
}

class Child extends Parent {
    String name = "Child";  // Hides the name variable in Parent
}

public class TestVariableHiding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent parent = new Parent();
        Child child = new Child();
        Parent parentRefToChild = new Child();

        System.out.println(parent.name);        // Output: Parent
        System.out.println(child.name);         // Output: Child
        System.out.println(parentRefToChild.name); // Output: Parent (variable hiding)
    }
}
```

### Important: 
- The field from the superclass is hidden when accessed through a subclass object, but when accessed using a superclass reference, the superclass field is used.
