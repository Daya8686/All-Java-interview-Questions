# 19. Difference between abstract class and interface? 


## Comparison: Abstract Class vs Interface

| Aspect              | Abstract Class                                                                 | Interface                                                                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | A class that can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with implementation). | A blueprint that contains only abstract methods (before Java 8) and default/static methods (from Java 8 onwards). |
| **Method Implementation** | Can have both abstract and concrete methods.                                 | Methods are abstract by default (Java 7 and earlier). From Java 8 onwards, it can have default and static methods. |
| **Fields**          | Can have instance variables (both static and non-static) with any access specifier. | Can only have static final (constant) variables. All fields are public, static, and final by default. |
| **Inheritance**     | A class can extend only one abstract class.                                      | A class can implement multiple interfaces.                                               |
| **Constructors**    | Can have a constructor to initialize fields.                                     | Cannot have constructors (since there are no fields to initialize).                      |
| **Access Modifiers**| Can define methods with any access modifier (public, protected, etc.).           | All methods are public by default, no explicit modifier required.                        |
| **Usage**           | Used when classes share common behavior but also require some default functionality. | Used to define a contract that implementing classes must follow, promoting loose coupling and flexibility. |
