## 8 What is meant by static polymorphism?

## Static Polymorphism (Compile-time Polymorphism)

### Definition

Static polymorphism refers to the ability of a programming language to resolve method calls at compile time. It occurs when the method to be invoked is determined during compilation, and the decision is made based on the method's signature (name, number, and type of parameters).

### How it Occurs

- **Method Overloading:** Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists.
- **Static, Final, and Private Methods:** These methods cannot be overridden, hence the method to be executed is determined at compile time.

### Example 1

```java
class Printer {
    void print(int x) {
        System.out.println("Integer: " + x);
    }

    void print(String x) {
        System.out.println("String: " + x);
    }
}

public class TestStaticPoly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        printer.print(10);          // Integer version called
        printer.print("Hello");     // String version called
    }
}
```

### Example 2
```java
class Animal {
    static void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }

    private void run() {
        System.out.println("Animal is running");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    static void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    private void run() {
        System.out.println("Dog is running");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal.sound();  // Calls Animal's sound method (static binding)
        myDog.sound();   // Calls Animal's sound method (static binding)
        
        Dog myActualDog = new Dog();
        myActualDog.sound(); // Calls Dog's sound method (static binding)
        
        // myDog.run(); // Error: run() has private access in Animal
    }
}

```

#### Key Points:
- Static polymorphism is eager: The method to execute is determined during compile time, ensuring early binding.
- It's faster due to early binding.
- No runtime overhead.
