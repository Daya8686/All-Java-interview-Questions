# 13. What is abstract class?

## Abstract Class in Java

### Definition

An abstract class in Java is a class that is declared with the `abstract` keyword. It can have both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation). Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly; they are meant to be extended by other classes that implement the abstract methods.

### Key Points

- Can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods.
- Can have instance variables, constructors, and static methods.
- The first subclass that extends an abstract class must provide implementations for all its abstract methods, unless the subclass is also abstract.
- Provides a common base class for related classes.

### Example

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // Abstract method (no body)
    
    void sleep() {          // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class TestAbstractClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
        dog.sleep();  // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}
```
