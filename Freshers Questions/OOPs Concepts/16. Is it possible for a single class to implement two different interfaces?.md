# 16. Is it possible for a single class to implement two different interfaces?

## Implementing Multiple Interfaces in Java

### Definition

Yes, a single class can implement multiple interfaces in Java. This is because interfaces provide a way to define a contract of behavior that a class must follow, but they do not dictate how the class should implement those behaviors. Since interfaces only declare methods without defining them (until Java 8 with default methods), a class can implement multiple interfaces without any conflicts, as long as it provides the implementation for all abstract methods.

### Key Points

- Java allows multiple inheritance of behavior through interfaces.
- If two interfaces have methods with the same signature, the class must implement the method for both.
- We cannot call the static method of an interface inside the class that provides the implementation for this interface with the class instance, but we can call it using the interface name.
- Static methods are like rules to the subclass, which must commonly contain them.
- We can also do method hiding in the subclass.
- If the interfaces have conflicting default methods, the implementing class must override the conflicting method.

### Example

```java
interface Printable {
    void print();
}

interface Showable {
    void show();
}

class Document implements Printable, Showable {
    @Override
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing document");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Showing document");
    }
}

public class TestMultipleInterfaces {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.print();  // Output: Printing document
        doc.show();   // Output: Showing document
    }
}
```

### Conclusion: 
- Implementing multiple interfaces allows for flexibility and modular design, as long as the class properly handles any method conflicts.
