# 25. What do you mean by data encapsulation?

## Data Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming

Data encapsulation is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), where data (fields) and methods that operate on the data are bundled together within a class, and the access to this data is restricted from the outside world.

Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface to interact with that state. This is typically done by declaring fields as private and providing getter and setter methods to access and modify them.

### Example

```java
class Employee {
    private String name; // Private field (encapsulation)

    // Getter method to access private field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method to modify private field
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

## Advantages of Encapsulation

1. **Security:** It prevents unauthorized access to the internal data.
2. **Controlled Access:** By using getters and setters, you can control how data is accessed or modified.
3. **Maintainability:** Changes to the internal representation of data can be made without affecting code that uses the class.
4. **In Practice:** Encapsulation is used to protect the integrity of data and ensure that modifications occur through well-defined methods rather than directly manipulating fields.
