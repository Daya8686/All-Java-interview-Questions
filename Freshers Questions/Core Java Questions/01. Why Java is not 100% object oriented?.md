## Why Java is Not 100% Object-Oriented

Java is not 100% object-oriented because it uses primitive data types (e.g., `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.), which are not objects. Java allows developers to use these types for performance reasons, as working with objects can be slower and require more memory than using primitives.

### Key Points to Consider

- **Primitive Data Types:**
  - Java includes 8 primitive types (`int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) which are not objects.
  - These types do not follow OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance.

- **Use of Static Methods:**
  - Static methods, like those in the `Math` class, can be invoked without creating an object, which breaks the strict "everything is an object" rule in OOP.

- **Operators:**
  - Java has operators like `+`, `-`, and `*`, which operate directly on primitive types, not objects.

- **Wrapper Classes:**
  - Although Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Character`, `Boolean`) to wrap primitives into objects, the use of primitives themselves still means Java isn't fully object-oriented.

- **Main Method:**
  - The entry point for any Java program is the main method, which is static. It doesnâ€™t need an object of the class to be invoked.
